the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound . 
a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 
the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .

on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation .
