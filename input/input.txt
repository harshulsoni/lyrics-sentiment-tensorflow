the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound . 
a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 
the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
